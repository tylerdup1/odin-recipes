# odin-recipes
This is a recipe repo to follow along with Odin Project lesson.

In this project, I will set up a basic HTML webpage using the previous lessons that I've learned in the odin project. These lessons include, but are not limited to:

- Setting up the basic layout of an HTML page (doctype, charset, head, body)
- Writing paragraphs and lists using p, ol/ul, li, br, 
- Emphasizing or Italicizing using strong, em, b, i.
- Inlcude absolute and relative links
- Include images using absolute and relative links, altering dimensions
- Adding alt text to image descriptions
- Adding directories to parent directory, storing pages in those child directories
- Making staging changes, making commits w/ messages using git
- and more...

This project will describe how to make a delicious spaghetti that I like to cook for my family. It is always a cozy meal to have year-round, but especially in the fall and winter months.
