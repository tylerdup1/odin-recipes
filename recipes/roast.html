    <h2>Tyler's Humble Roast</h2>
    <p>This is one of my favorite things to eat. I like to have it any time of the year<br>
    but especially during the colder months. This recipe is simple and straightforward,<br>
    and yields a tender, flavorful roast that is perfect for a family dinner or special occasion.<br>
    This recipe is made for a crock pot, but will work just as well in a conventional oven.</p><br>

        <li>Transfer the seared roast to the crock pot.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion, potatoes, carrots, and sliced garlic around the roast in the crock pot.</li>

        <li>Cover the crock pot with its lid and cook on low for 8-10 hours,<br>

    </ol>

    <p>Note: This recipe is great by itself, but also pairs well with rice<br>
        if you would like an even more filling meal!</p>
